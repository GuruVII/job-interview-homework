### The outer divs appear, but there is nothing inside
I've enouctered this problem once and I've failed to reacreate it, but clicking RESTORE DEFAULTS fixed it for me.

### Special Note
currently liverealoding is disabled, if you wish it to work, you have to go into the webpack.config.js and uncomment LiveReload and stats
